I am going to implement the bubble sort method

Bubble sort
Compare adjacent elements
Swap them if the first element is greater than the second.
After each pass the largest element will go  to the end of the list
The process repeats till it get sorted
The maximum number of passes will be (no:of elements-1)


Bubble sort test on [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6].

expected output [1,2,5,5,6,9].
