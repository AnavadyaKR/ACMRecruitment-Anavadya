Question

Reverse a string using both:
1. Iterative method
2. Recursive method  
(Without using built-in reverse functions)

Iterative Method
- Start from the last character and build the reversed string step by step.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (ignore output string).

Recursive Method
- Base case: If the string is empty or has one character, return it.
- Recursive case: Reverse the substring from index 1 onward, then add the first character at the end.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursion stack).
