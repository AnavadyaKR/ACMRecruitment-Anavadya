Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


Approach

1. The problem is to shift all elements to the right by `k` steps.
2. We can solve this:
   - Normalize `k` as `k = k % len(nums)` (to handle large k values).
   - Reverse the whole array
   - Reverse the first k elements.
   - Reverse the remaining elements.
3. This uses the array reversal trick, which rotates in-place.
4. Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3

- Reverse whole array → [7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
- Reverse first 3 → [5,6,7,4,3,2,1]
- Reverse remaining → [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Final Answer: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
