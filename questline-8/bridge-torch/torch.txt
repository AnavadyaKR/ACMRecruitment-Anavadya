Four people need to cross a narrow bridge at night with only one torch.  
- Crossing times: P1 = 1 min, P2 = 2 min, P3 = 7 min, P4 = 10 min  
- Bridge rules:
  - Maximum 2 people can cross at a time
  - The torch is required for crossing
  - Crossing time = slower person's time
  - Someone must bring the torch back if people remain on the original side
LOGIC 

Move	Who Crosses	Time (min)	Side after crossing
1	P1 & P2		2		Left: P3,P4     Right: P1,P2
2	P1 returns	1		Left: P1,P3,P4  Right: P2
3	P3 & P4		10		Left: P1        Right: P2,P3,P4
4	P2 returns	2		Left: P1,P2     Right: P3,P4
5	P1 & P2		2		Left: none      Right: P1,P2,P3,P4(all crossed)

So total time taken = 17 minutes

Reason:
Minimum time spent  to bring torch back to left side 
To spent minimum time fastest people p1 and p2 are taken for bringing the torch back
Avoiding pairing of slowest person and the fastest person as the pace of crossing =slow persons time
Pairing slowest people together
therefore crossing time will be minimum which is 17 minutes
